									<p>Ruth has competed in SciOly since middle school and can't wait for her sixth year. SciO is her favorite extracurricular because it gives her the oppurtunity to meet lots of cool people and win awards ;P She also likes to make and browse memes, code, birdwatch, and paint. Her favorite <strike>government spy drone</strike> bird is the harpy eagle. She hopes the team will do even better next year!</p>

									<p>This will be Rhea's 8th year competing in Science Olympiad. She is also co-founder of Students for Students, a tutoring and coding teaching service for elementary and middle school students. Outside of SciOly, Rhea also dances, reads, is a DECA NorCal finalist, and hates hugs from her secretary. :) Rather than a glass empty vs. full philsophy, Rhea has a "the point is it's refillable" mindset. She is extremely excited about the upcoming 2020-21 season (top 3 at states woo!!)</p>

									<p>Abinayaa is excited to be participating in Science Olympiad ever since elementary school, and she loves competing with the team because she is given an opportunity to study a wide variety of sciences. Besides Science Olympiad, Abinayaa volunteers with her school’s Musical Therapy Club as well as at a hospital. In her free time, she reads, listens to music, and gives lots of hugs. Abinayaa has high hopes for this year’s SciOly season!</p>

									<p>As a part of Science Olympiad for the 4th year, Garima hopes the 2020-21 season be better than the last. :)) Outside of SciOly, she spends an excessive amount of time reading or coding and hopes the pandemic ends so she can interact with other fellow humans again. She is excited for another year of pestering Ruth with all of her questions and getting top 3 in states. :D</p>

									<p>Nandana will be competing in Science Olympiad for her fifth season this year, and she is extremely grateful for all of the amazing people and fields of science it has introduced her to. Outside of Science Olympiad, Nandana likes to play the piano, read, and practice driving (gotta get that license!). She is ready for the season to begin, and hopes this will be American's best year yet!</p>

                <h3>About Our Teams</h3>
                <p>All students attending American High School are welcome to try out for our teams at the beginning of the year. Each year, we choose 15 people for each team. Our tryout process entails trying out for specific events covering all the theory subjects, as well as builds that individuals are interested in. Once teams are selected, each student competes in 3-4 events along with a partner or trio. AHS regularly attends the Golden Gate Invitational, Bay Area Regional Science Olympiad, and Northern California States competitions.</p>

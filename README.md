# AHS Science Olympiad Website

Good luck to whoever has to maintain this after me. If you want to roast my sloppy "code" or ask for what I was thinking when I ~~stole~~ wrote this "code" contact me at birddrawer@gmail.com.

## Alert Banner

The website has an alert banner that can be activated on the index page by uncommenting the below code. See example of how banner looks below.

## Gallery

When you add an image to the gallery, remember to also add it to the list of images/captions in the gallery for the modal. See code below.
